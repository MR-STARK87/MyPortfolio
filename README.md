# Personal Portfolio ‚Äî Syed Zaid Ali

A clean, responsive single-page portfolio I built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. I designed it with a modern aesthetic, complete with dark/light theme support, smooth scrolling, and thoughtful interactive elements.

## ‚ú® What I Built

I created a fully responsive portfolio site featuring:

- **Single-page architecture** with dedicated sections: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact
- **Theme switching** between dark and light modes with localStorage persistence
- **Smooth scroll behavior** with offset adjustments for fixed navigation
- **Accessibility-first approach** including keyboard navigation and proper focus management
- **Interactive project cards** linking to live demos and repositories
- **Functional contact form** integrated with Formspree, including spam protection via honeypot
- **Polished UI details** like an animated cursor, scroll progress indicator, and reveal-on-scroll animations
- **Enhanced UX touches** such as copy-to-clipboard for email, back-to-top button, and draft persistence for the contact form

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

I kept the stack intentionally lean to demonstrate my fundamentals:

- **HTML5** ‚Äì Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** ‚Äì Custom properties, flexbox/grid layouts, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äì No frameworks, just clean ES6+ code
- **External libraries:**
  - Smooth Scroll polyfill (CDN)
  - Font Awesome icons (CDN)

## üéØ Key Highlights

- **Performance-focused**: Minimal dependencies and optimized assets
- **Mobile-first design**: Tested across devices and screen sizes
- **Clean codebase**: Organized, commented, and maintainable
- **User-centric**: Built with real-world usability and accessibility in mind
